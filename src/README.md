# Duena Revival source files
This is where unneccesary source files are stocked. IF you're installing duena to only use it, you can safely delete this `src` folder.

Here, you'll find the following:
- the `languages` folder: It contains additional unfinished languages fetched from [this archive](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/duena) and updated for DuenaRevival. It also contains `DuenaRevival.pot`, which is a template to add new languages.
- the `style-scss` folder which generates `style.css`, used by the theme.
- the `bootstrap-scss` folder which contains the scss source files for bootstrap.
- `sass-compile.sh`, a script to compile bootstrap's and style scss files.
