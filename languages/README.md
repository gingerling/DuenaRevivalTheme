# DuenaRevival language packs
These files are .po (and sometimes .mo) files used for translation.
The files are from [this archive](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/duena) and updated for DuenaRevival.

Translators, feel free to translate them and make pull requests to expand the translation of the theme. :)

## Install
When you install the theme in your wordpress, feel free to only keep the language(s) you're interested, as long as you:
- keep `en_EN.mo` and `en_EN.po` for the missing strings
- compile the `.mo` file of your language if it's missing in the repository (using POEditor for instance)
